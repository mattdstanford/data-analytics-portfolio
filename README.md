# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains applied data analysis and modeling projects demonstrating my experience with statistical analysis, data validation, experimental reasoning, and interpretable machine learning. My background combines experimental research with practical data analytics, with emphasis on careful inference, limitations, and communication.

## Projects

### Measurement Bias in NYC Taxi Tip Data
Developed and assessed linear regression models to elucidate relationships between trip characteristics and reported tip amounts, including categorical predictors. Confirmed a data collection bias by reconstructing total transaction amounts, demonstrating that apparent payment-type dependent effects reflect inconsistent tip tracking, not rider behavior.

### Rapid-Onset Vasodilation in Human Skeletal Muscle
Analyzed experimental time-series data using group comparisons to quantify acute blood flow responses to brief muscle contraction. Interpreted vascular responses patterns in the context of contraction intensity/type and training status.

### Employee Attrition Prediction in Electric Vehicle Manufacturing
Developed and assessed supervised machine learning models to predict employee attrition using existing job-related variables. Utilized SHAP-based model interpretation to identify, and elucidate interactions between, key drivers of attrition, in order to generate actionable company recommendations.


## Tools & Methods
Python, R, linear regression, supervised machine learning, model diagnostics, experimental design, data visualization, and reproducible analysis.
